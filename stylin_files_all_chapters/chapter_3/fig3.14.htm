Think of it as a long, thin snake contained within the paragraph's box. The paragraph is a containing box, but CSS also applies a box around the text text itself, and it is this inner box to which the text properties are applied. In this example, the containing element's box is in red and the inner box around the text is in green. As you can see from the way the inner box is drawn, CSS sees the text as one long strip, even though the width of the container causes it to be broken across several lines.</span></p><!--end footer--> </body></html><!--end sample doc-->
