It was published in 1925, pre-dating J.R.R.    Tolkien's "The Hobbit" by ten years. The book tells the tale tells the story    of two small children, Joe and Sylvia, who have been rescued from their awful    lives by Miss Watkyns, who runs the Society for the Removal of Superfluous    Children, and transported to the relative safety of the Land of Snergs. </p>  <p>The Snergs are a robust and helpful race of short people "only slightly    taller than the average table'', who provide a number of services to the children's    refuge. There, the two children, who are always up to mischief, meet Gorbo,    an opininated and self-confident Snerg, and together they embark on a series    of adventures.</p><blockquote>I should like to record my own love and my children's love of    E. A. Wyke-Smith's "The Marvellous Land of Snergs", at any rate to the Snerg    element in that tale, and of Gorbo, the gem of dunderheads, jewel of a companion	in an escapade&#8230;(The story) was probably an unconscious source-book for the    Hobbits&#8230;<p>J.R.R. Tolkien</p></blockquote>  <p>Gorbo foolishly takes the children to the see the forest of Twisted Trees, where they 	become hopelessly lost. They  find their way into an underground cavern 	and begin a long and sometimes frightening  journey.</p><p>Along the way, they encounter a forest inhabited by friendly cinnamon bears,    a pathetically cowardly knight called Sir Percival, a reformed ogre, Golithos,    who is trying to mend his ways (he longer eats children and has become a    vegetarian) and a wicked witch named Mother Meldrum. <br />	<a href="story.htm">Read more about "The Marvellous Land of Snergs"</a></p>	<div id="footer">	<ul>     <li><a href="#">The Story</a></li>     <li><a href="#">Illustrations</a></li>     <li><a href="#">The Author</a></li>     <li><a href="#">Related Links</a></li>     <li><a href="#">Contact Us</a></li>    </ul>   <ul class="fineprint">    <li>&copy; 2005 Wyke-Smith Family Trust - all rights reserved</li>    <li><a href="#">fine print</a></li>    <li><a href="#">terms of use</a></li>    </ul>	</div></div><!--end of content div--><div id="rightcolumn"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1882968042/qid=1110169295/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-3869840-5485440"><img src="images/snergs_book_promo.jpg" width="156" height="211" alt="Buy 'The Marvellous Land of Snergs' at Amazon.com" /></a>  <div id="newslinks">  <h3>Snergs News</h3>  <ul>  <li><a href="#">"Snergs" to be re-published by Cold Spring Press - Summer 2005</a></li>  <li><a href="#">Douglas Anderson, Tolkien scholar, discusses the Snergs</a></li>  <li class="morelink"><a href="#">more news</a></li>  </ul>  </div></div></div><!--end container--></body></html>
